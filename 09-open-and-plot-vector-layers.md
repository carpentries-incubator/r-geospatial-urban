Make sure that the `sf` package and its dependencies are installed before the 
workshop. The installation can be lengthy, so allocate enough extra time 
before the workshop for solving installation problems. We recommend one
or two installation 'walk-in' hours on a day before the workshop. Also, 15-30 
minutes at the beginning of the first workshop day should be enough to tackle 
last-minute installation issues.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::: prereq

In this lesson you will work with the `sf` package. Note that the `sf` package has some external dependencies, namely GEOS, PROJ.4, GDAL and UDUNITS, which need to be installed beforehand. Before starting the lesson, follow the workshop [setup instructions](../learners/setup.md) for the installation of `sf` and its dependencies.

:::

First we need to load the packages we will use in this lesson. We will use the `tidyverse` package with which you are already familiar from the previous lesson. In addition, we need to load the [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package for working with spatial vector data. 


```r
library(tidyverse)  # wrangle, reshape and visualize data
library(sf)         # work with spatial vector data
```

# The `sf` package

`sf` stands for Simple Features which is a standard defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium for storing and accessing geospatial vector data. PostGIS, for instance, uses the same standard, so PostGIS users might recognise the functions used by the `sf` package. 

:::

## Import shapefiles

Let's start by opening a shapefile. Shapefiles are a common file format to store spatial vector data used in GIS software. Note that a shapefile consists of multiple files and it is important to keep them all together in the same location. We will read a shapefile with the administrative boundary of Delft with the function `st_read()` from the `sf` package. 


```r
boundary_Delft <- st_read("data/delft-boundary.shp", quiet = TRUE)
```

::: callout

# All `sf` functions start with `st_`

Note that all functions from the `sf` package start with the standard prefix `st_` which stands for Spatial Type. This is helpful in at least two ways:  

1. it allows for easy autocompletion of function names in RStudio, and
2. it makes the interaction with or translation to/from software using the simple features standard like PostGIS easy.

:::

## Spatial Metadata

By default (with `quiet = FALSE`), the `st_read()` function provides a message with a summary of metadata about the file that was read in. To examine the metadata in more detail, we can use other, more specialised, functions from the `sf` package.  

The `st_geometry_type()` function, for instance, gives us information about the geometry type, which in this case is `POLYGON`.


```r
st_geometry_type(boundary_Delft)
```

```output
[1] POLYGON
18 Levels: GEOMETRY POINT LINESTRING POLYGON MULTIPOINT ... TRIANGLE
```

The `st_crs()` function returns the coordinate reference system (CRS) used by the shapefile, which in this case is `WGS 84` and has the unique reference code `EPSG: 4326`. 


```r
st_crs(boundary_Delft)
```

```output
Coordinate Reference System:
  User input: WGS 84 
  wkt:
GEOGCRS["WGS 84",
    DATUM["World Geodetic System 1984",
        ELLIPSOID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]]],
    PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
        ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    CS[ellipsoidal,2],
        AXIS["latitude",north,
            ORDER[1],
            ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
        AXIS["longitude",east,
            ORDER[2],
            ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    ID["EPSG",4326]]
```

# Examining the output of `st_crs()`

As the output of `st_crs()` can be long, you can use `$Name` and `$epsg` after the `crs()` call to extract the projection name and EPSG code respectively.

:::

The `st_bbox()` function shows the extent of the layer. As `WGS 84` is a **geographic CRS**, the extent of the shapefile is displayed in degrees.



```r
st_bbox(boundary_Delft)
```

```output
     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax 
 4.320218 51.966316  4.407911 52.032599 
```

We need a **projected CRS**, which in the case of the Netherlands is typically the Amersfort / RD New projection. To reproject our shapefile, we will use the `st_transform()` function. For the `crs` argument we can use the EPSG code of the CRS we want to use, which is `28992` for the `Amersfort / RD New` projection. 
To check the EPSG code of any CRS, we can check this website: https://epsg.io/


```r
boundary_Delft <- st_transform(boundary_Delft, 28992)
st_crs(boundary_Delft)$Name
```

```output
[1] "Amersfoort / RD New"
```

```r
st_crs(boundary_Delft)$epsg
```

```output
[1] 28992
```

Notice that the bounding box is measured in meters after the transformation.


```r
st_bbox(boundary_Delft)
```

```output
     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax 
 81743.00 442446.21  87703.78 449847.95 
```

```r
st_crs(boundary_Delft)$units_gdal
```

```output
[1] "metre"
```

We confirm the transformation by examining the reprojected shapefile.


```r
boundary_Delft
```

```output
Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 1 field
Geometry type: POLYGON
Dimension:     XY
Bounding box:  xmin: 81743 ymin: 442446.2 xmax: 87703.78 ymax: 449848
Projected CRS: Amersfoort / RD New
  osm_id                       geometry
1 324269 POLYGON ((87703.78 442651, ...
```

Read more about Coordinate Reference Systems [here](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs.html). We will also practice transformation between CRS in [Handling Spatial Projection & CRS](../episodes/12-handling-spatial-projection-and-crs.Rmd).

## Plot a vector layer

Now, let's plot this shapefile. You are already familiar with the `ggplot2` package from [Introduction to Visualisation](../episodes/04-intro-to-visualisation.Rmd). `ggplot2` has special `geom_` functions for spatial data. We will use the `geom_sf()` function for `sf` data.


```r
ggplot(data = boundary_Delft) +
  geom_sf(size = 3, color = "black", fill = "cyan1") +
  labs(title = "Delft Administrative Boundary") +
  coord_sf(datum = st_crs(28992)) # displays the axes in meters
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

### Challenge: Import line and point vector layers

Read in `delft-streets.shp` and `delft-leisure.shp` and assign them to `lines_Delft` and `points_Delft` respectively. Answer the following questions:

1. What type of R spatial object is created when you import each layer?
2. What is the CRS and extent for each object?
3. Do the files contain points, lines, or polygons?
4. How many features are in each file?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 


```r
lines_Delft <- st_read("data/delft-streets.shp")
points_Delft <- st_read("data/delft-leisure.shp")
```

We can check the type of type of geometry with the `st_geometry_type()` function. `lines_Delft` contains `"LINESTRING"` geometry and `points_Delft` is made of `"POINT"` geometries. 


```r
st_geometry_type(lines_Delft)[1]
```

```output
[1] LINESTRING
18 Levels: GEOMETRY POINT LINESTRING POLYGON MULTIPOINT ... TRIANGLE
```

```r
st_geometry_type(points_Delft)[2]
```

```output
[1] POINT
18 Levels: GEOMETRY POINT LINESTRING POLYGON MULTIPOINT ... TRIANGLE
```

`lines_Delft` and `points_Delft` are in the correct CRS.


```r
st_crs(lines_Delft)$epsg
```

```output
[1] 28992
```

```r
st_crs(points_Delft)$epsg
```

```output
[1] 28992
```

When looking at the bounding boxes with the `st_bbox()` function, we see the spatial extent of the two objects in a projected CRS using meters as units. `lines_Delft()` and `points_Delft` have similar extents.


```r
st_bbox(lines_Delft)
```

```output
     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax 
 81759.58 441223.13  89081.41 449845.81 
```

```r
st_bbox(points_Delft)
```

```output
     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax 
 81863.21 442621.15  87370.15 449345.08 
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Metadata for vector layers include geometry type, CRS, and extent.
- Load spatial objects into R with the `st_read()` function.
- Spatial objects can be plotted directly with `ggplot2` using the `geom_sf()` function. No need to convert to a data frame.
