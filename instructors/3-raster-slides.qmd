## Outline

1. Intro to raster data: packages, metadata (CRS, resolution)
2. Plotting raster data
3. Reprojecting raster data
4. Raster calculations
5. Working with multi-band rasters


## `raster` package for spatial raster data

## Challenge 1: `r emo::ji("clock")` **2 mins**

Use `GDALinfo()` to determine the following about the `tud-dsm-hill.tif` file:

1. Does this file have the same CRS as `DSM_TUD`?
2. What is resolution of the raster data?
3. How large would a 5x5 pixel area be on the Earth’s surface?
4. Is the file a multi- or single-band raster?

``` {r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 2)
``` 



## Challenge 2: `r emo::ji("clock")` **5 mins**

Create a plot of the TU Delft Digital Surface Model (`DSM_TUD`) that has:

1. Six classified ranges of values (break points) that are evenly divided among the range of pixel values.
2. Axis labels.
3. A plot title.

``` {r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5)
``` 



## Challenge 3: `r emo::ji("clock")` **8 mins**

Use the `tud-dtm.tif` and `tud-dtm-hill.tif` files from the `data` directory to create a Digital Terrain Model map of the TU Delft area.

Make sure to:

- include hillshade in the maps,
- label axes,
- include a title for each map,
- experiment with various alpha values and color palettes to represent the data. 

``` {r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 8)
``` 

## Challenge 4: `r emo::ji("clock")` **2 mins**

View the CRS for each of these two datasets. What projection does each use?

``` {r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 2)
``` 

## Challenge 5: `r emo::ji("clock")` **5 mins**

It’s often a good idea to explore the range of values in a raster dataset just like we might explore a dataset that we collected in the field.

1. What is the min and maximum value for the Canopy Height Model `CHM_TUD` that we just created?
2. What are two ways you can check this range of data for `CHM_TUD`?
3. What is the distribution of all the pixel values in the CHM?
4. Plot a histogram with 6 bins instead of the default and change the color of the histogram.
5. Plot the `CHM_TUD` raster using breaks that make sense for the data. Include an appropriate color palette for the data, plot title and no axes ticks / labels.

``` {r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5)
```
